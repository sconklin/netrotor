The only two files that I'm actively working on at the moment are server-wconfig.go and the config file multirotorconf.json

Ignore the actual UDP networking code in main(), I'll get to that later. The basic problem I was trying to solve is parsing a config file and getting that into config variables in the main program.

What I'm doing seems to work but it seems pretty clunky. Any somments on stayle or alternate methods are welcome.

Thanks!
